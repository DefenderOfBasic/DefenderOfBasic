I am currently working on co-founding ORI with [@mettafive](https://github.com/mettafive/) and [@suntzoogway](https://github.com/SunTzoogway/). ORI is an alignment institute. You come to ORI with a project you want to work on, and it finds you collaborators & funding. In that way, it is an incubator/investor. But if you already have those resources, you've already done good work and now it just needs to reach the people who could benefit from it, then it switches into helping propagating that work. In that way, it's a marketing company. The idea of "full-stack alignment" is that wherever the bottleneck is, ORI can identify it. 

Other projects on my plate:

- Open Memetics Github (https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/open-memetics-institute/) - building a "canon" for an open memetics community
- Anatomy of an Internet Argument (https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-an-internet-argument) - a long running field experiment in pro-social cultural engineering
