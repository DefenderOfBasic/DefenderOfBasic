I am currently working on co-founding ORI with [@mettafive](https://github.com/mettafive/) and [@suntzoogway](https://github.com/SunTzoogway/). ORI is an alignment institute. You come to ORI with a project you want to work on, and it finds you collaborators & funding. In that way, it is an incubator/investor. But if you already have those resources, you've already done good work and now it just needs to reach the people who could benefit from it, then it switches into helping propagating that work. In that way, it's a marketing company. The idea of "full-stack alignment" is that wherever the bottleneck is, ORI can identify it. 

Projects on my plate:

- [ORI website redesign + pitch](https://github.com/Open-Research-Institute/open-research-institute.github.io/issues/34) for fundraising for at least 2 full-time ORI staff for a year 
- Science communication for God Conjecture (incubated within ORI) - https://github.com/SASenchal/God-Conjecture
- Open Memetics Github (https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/open-memetics-institute/) - building a "canon" for an open memetics community
- Anatomy of an Internet Argument (https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-an-internet-argument) - a long running field experiment in pro-social cultural engineering

Backburner:

- [ORI onboarding book](https://github.com/Open-Research-Institute/onboarding) - this is an "open source book". I want to popularize open source books, and this one is kind of the "basic shared truths" that everyone in ORI shares (with the idea that, as new people join, they glance at all the claims, and if there is one they disagree with, they can go in and edit it on GitHub and ORI debates it)
- Discourse mapping tools
